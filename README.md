# Objectives
In Space Explorer, your only objective is to make it to the flag for all of the levels! There are currently 3 levels in the game that you must complete to beat the game. 

In each level, there are certain items that will assist you in getting to the flag. These items include:
- Coins: Coins give you 100 points each, and give you an extra life after collecting 20 of them
- Heart Potions: Refills one of your hearts if you have any lost and gives points
- 1up Crystals: Give you an extra life and points
- Speed Shoes: Boost your speed for 6 seconds and points
- Invincibilty Potion: Gives you invincibility for 6 seconds and points

There are also certain items and entities that will make it more difficult to reach the flag:
- Turtle: Item that will slow your speed for 6 seconds and takes away points 
- Octopus: Enemy that will continue moving until they collide with a block, where they will bounce off and continue to move unless they fall into a hole
- Alien: Enemy that will bounce back and forth on the platform that it is sitting on
